# Turning styling from CSS to SCSS

For this project I borrowed the code from website that was used as teaching material at Codecademy. The site was styled in CSS and flipped it over to SCSS. I really like the struckture of SCSS and it is much clearer and easier to read and work on than plain CSS. It was a steep learning curve to set up the gulp and get my head around how to make all the new files, and to understand the structure of SCSS. But I got there in the end. 

*The old CSS styles can be found in the ´borrowed styles.css´file*
